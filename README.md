# leafletNodeJS
Basic Esri Leaflet three.js hybrid example.

This is a basic Node.js application that is designed to support the following use cases and technical requirements:

* Integrate a 2d and 3d view based on a map extent
* Support ArcGIS.com base maps
* Leaflet and no Dojo

[Three.js](http://threejs.org) is a JavaScript 3D library and is used to support edge case scenarios such as sub-surface mapping.

## Prerequisites

* Node.js installed

## Getting Started

1.  Clone the Application
2.  CD to the Application
3.  Install npm dependencies<br><pre><code>npm install</code></pre>
4.  Install JavaScript packages<br><pre><code>bower install</code></pre>
5.  Start Node Server<br><pre><code>node server.js</code></pre>
6.  Open a browser and go to http://localhost:1337/

<b>NOTE:</b>  Node is only used to serve up the web application on a development environment.  The web app can be deployed to a server or PaaS that is not using Node.

## Roadmap

* Integrate 3d point cloud data via 3.js surface.  See: https://github.com/mmillsAspect/leafletNodeJS/issues
